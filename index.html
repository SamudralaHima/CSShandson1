    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <div class="e">
        <ul>
            <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
            <li>Internal - by using a style elements in the head section</li>
            <li>External - by using a link elements to link to an external CSS file.</li>
            <li>
                The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the style in external CSS file. However, <span class="f">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal style,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="g">
        <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also spcial in that you can use a special in that you can use a spcial URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
        <p>in CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of element on a wed page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of style can be applied to the element.</p>
        <p>There is a wide range of selectors availble. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to whicha style should be applied.</p>
